## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+ / tvOS 9.0+
- Xcode 9.0+
- Swift 4.2+

## Usage

### Hello World

The first example is the simplest way to use the `Splitflap` component. Here how to display this "Hello" text:

![Hello](https://github.com/sgbryson/Splitflap/blob/master/splitflap-hello.gif)

```swift
import Splitflap

let splitflapView        = Splitflap(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 370, height: 53))
splitflapView.datasource = self

// Set the text to display by animating the flaps
splitflapView.setText("Hello", animated: true)

// MARK: - Splitflap DataSource Methods

// Defines the number of flaps that will be used to display the text
func numberOfFlapsInSplitflap(_ splitflap: Splitflap) -> Int {
  return 5
}

```

### Theming

`Splitflap` allows you to customize each flap individually by providing a `splitflap:builderForFlapAtIndex:` delegate method:

![Theming](https://github.com/sgbryson/Splitflap/blob/master/splitflap-theming.gif)

```swift
let splitflapView        = Splitflap(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 370, height: 53))
splitflapView.delegate   = self
splitflapView.datasource = self

// Set the text with an emoji
splitflap.text = "Cat \u{1F63B}"

// MARK: - Splitflap Delegate Methods

// Configure the appearance for each flaps
func splitflap(_ splitflap: Splitflap, builderForFlapAtIndex index: Int) -> FlapViewBuilder {
  return FlapViewBuilder { builder in
    builder.backgroundColor = UIColor(red: 251/255, green: 249/255, blue: 243/255, alpha: 1)
    builder.cornerRadius    = 5
    builder.font            = UIFont(name: "Avenir-Black", size:45)
    builder.textAlignment   = .center
    builder.textColor       = UIColor(red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0, alpha: 0.5)
    builder.lineColor       = UIColor(red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0, alpha: 0.3)
  }
}

// MARK: - Splitflap DataSource Methods

func tokensInSplitflap(_ splitflap: Splitflap) -> [String] {
  return " Cat\u{1F63B}".characters.map { String($0) }
}
```

## Installation

#### CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```
Go to the directory of your Xcode project, and Create and Edit your Podfile and add _Splitflap_:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

use_frameworks!
pod 'Splitflap', '~> 4.1.0'
```

Install into your project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file):

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

You can now `import Splitflap` framework into your files.

#### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate `Splitflap` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile` file:

```ogdl
github "sgbryson/Splitflap" >= 4.1.0
```

#### Swift Package Manager

You can use [The Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) to install `Splitflap` by adding the proper description to your `Package.swift` file:
```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    targets: [],
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/sgbryson/Splitflap.git", versions: "4.1.0" ..< Version.max)
    ]
)
```

Note that the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) is still in early design and development, for more information checkout its [GitHub Page](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).

#### Manually

[Download](https://github.com/sgbryson/Splitflap/archive/master.zip) the project and copy the `Splitflap` folder into your project to use it in.
